While reading the survey paper on [Trends in Integration of Vision and Language Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09358) I came across the following broad research areas in NLP and CV domains, jotting them here for future reference.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**<br/>
- Predominantly tasks can be segregated as language understanding, langauge generation
- Language Understanding
   - Shallow Parsing, Syntax Parsing, Semantic Role Labeling, Named Entity Recognition
   - Entity Linking, Co-reference Resolution
- Language Generation
   - Machine Translation, Text Summarization, Question-Answering
   - Dialog Generation, Story telling

**Computer Vision (CV):**<br/>
- Predominantly tasks are segregated as (i) using image/video as inputs (ii) using image/video for representation
- Using as input
   - Image
       - Image Classification, Object Localization, Object Detection
       - Object Segmentation, Object Identification, Instance Segmentation, Panoptic Segmentation
   - Video
       - Action Classification, Object Tracking, Emotion Detection
       - Scene Detection, Automatic Editing

**NLP and CV Tasks Integration:**<br/>
- Extension of NLP tasks to leverage CV
    - [Visual Description Generation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088523081400093X), [Visual Story Telling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06023), [Visual Question-Answering](https://aclanthology.org/C00-1043.pdf)
