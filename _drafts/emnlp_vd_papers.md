Title: Learning to Ground Visual Objects for Visual Dialog
URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06013.pdf

Dataset: VisDial v0.9 and v1.0

Summary: locate related visual objects without any guidance [Question, Dialog History are not sufficient]
prior and posterior distributions over visual objects are used to facilitate visual objects grounding
Similar to **enhanced oracle **
