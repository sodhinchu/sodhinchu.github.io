	<h1>Hi There!</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD student at the [Computational Linguistics Lab, University of Potsdam](https://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/) under the supervision of [Dr David Schlangen](https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~das/), co-working with [Dr Maike Paetzel-Pr√ºsmann](https://www.maike-paetzel.de/).
	<br/><br/>
	My research work focuses on conversational-collaborative robots (aka COCOBOTS). I am broadly interested in vision and language grounding and multimodal conversational systems. I am also excited about cognitive psychology dimenstion in the interactions between humans and machines.<br/><br/> This blog is to document the learnings, questions, findings and experiments. <a href="/blog"><em>Read on about my explorations...</em></a>
