	<h1>Hi There!</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD student at the <a href="https://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/"><em>Computational Linguistics Lab, University of Potsdam</em></a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~das/"><em>Dr David Schlangen</em></a>, co-working with <a href="https://www.maike-paetzel.de/"><em>Dr Maike Paetzel-Pr√ºsmann</em></a>.
	<br/><br/>
	My research work focuses on conversational-collaborative robots (aka COCOBOTS). I am broadly interested in vision and language grounding and multimodal conversational systems. I am also excited about cognitive psychology aspects in the interactions between humans and machines.<br/><br/> This blog is to document the learnings, questions, findings and experiments. <a href="/blog"><em>Read on about my explorations...</em></a>
