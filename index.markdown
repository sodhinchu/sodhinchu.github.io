	<h1>Hi There!</h1>
	<p>I'm starting my #NLProc Journey. I am broadly interetsed in natural language processing, with sub themes of common sense reasoning, multimodal conversational systems, and also excited about its intersection with health and cognitive sciences.<br/><br/> This blog is to document the learnings, questions, findings and experiments.
